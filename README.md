# Artemis Engine

Welcome to the Artemis Engine! Artemis is a modern cross-platform 2D game engine designed on top of Monogame/Xna. This repository is the main repository for the Artemis Engine along with it's Unit Tests and Approval Tests.

## What makes Artemis Special?

The Artemis Engine is developed by a group of programmers with plenty of first-hand experience developing game engines and video games, so the vision and values of the Artemis Engine are directly in line with what a game developer would need.

The engine features

	- **Multiforms**: Similar to the Cocos2D engine, games are created using *Multiforms* that partition game logic into distinct objects.

	- **Polish**: One of the Artemis Engine's major focuses is the need for "polish" in a game; the small changes and additions you add to your game that make it a polished, finalized product. Often, a game's source code will be 20% actual game code and 80% polish code. Artemis Engine cuts that down significantly with many builtin features.

	- **Builtin Runtime Automated Testing**: Automated testing of games is a heavily unexplored direction for game engines to take. Artemis Engine goes to new heights by supplying a variety of useful tools for automatically testing your game's features, such as *user input simulation*, *automated benchmarking*, and *approval testing*.

Artemis Engine values

	- **OOP** and **SOLID** design principles.

	- **Agile Development Methodology**.

	- **Fast** and **flexible** game development.
	
	- **KISS** Principle.

## Projects

### Artemis.Engine

The `Artemis.Engine` project is the main class library for the engine, where all core game components such as the `Engine` object itself are stored.

### Artemis.UnitTests

The `Artemis.UnitTests` project is the main unit test project.

### Artemis.ApprovalTests

The `Artemis.ApprovalTests` project is where "approval tests" for the engine are placed. An approval test doesn't have a "yes" or "no" answer like a unit test does. Approval tests are tests that ensure the engine is fulfilling it's requirements to adequate satisfaction and beyond. They directly test the engine's features by testing how they would work **in a real game development environment**.

## How to get started?

If you want to contribute, fork the repository and get to work! There are lots of ways you can help out!

Since the engine is currently in its very early develompent stages, heavy coordination between the project manager and contributors is required. If you'd like to help develop the engine, you can contact the project manager at Michaelfonzolo@gmail.com. 

Alternatively, you can look for currently open issues for the project and address them on your own.
